# Program Name: Chapter 2_First Steps in Programming
===============================

## Overview
# variable
- "This whole idea of entering different information each time you run a program is key to the whole enterprise of programming. "
- variables are used to store information
- data stores in Main memory or RAM
- ROM =The information contained in ROM was put there when the machine was manufactured(Basic Input/Output System(BIOS) /ex. display, hard disk drive, key board, floppy disk drive)
- RAM = where your programs and data are stored when they execute.(either the box is full when it represents 1 or the box is empty when it represents 0.)
- each byte has been labeled with a number(This label for a byte is called its address)

# memory in your computer
- 1 is true, 0 is false
- 1 kilobyte (or 1KB) is 1,024 bytes.(1024 = 2^10 / 18bits)
- 1 megabyte (or 1MB) is 1,024 kilobytes, which is 1,048,576 bytes.(1024^2 = 2^20 / 28bits)
- 1 gigabyte (or 1GB) is 1,024 megabytes, which is 1,073,741,841 bytes.(1024^3 = 2^30 / 38bits)
- The reason is this: there are 1,024 numbers from 0 to 1,023, and 1,023 happens to be 10 bits that are all 1 in binary: 11 1111 1111, which is a very convenient binary value.
- "=" is an assignment operator / variable = value
- An argument is a value that’s passed to a function.
- %d = conversion specifier

# variable name
- variable declaration first, then assignment
- A variable name can’t include any other characters besides letters, underscores, and digits
- variable names are case sensitive

# Arithmetic Operation
"int Cats = 2;"
- This statement declares the variable Cats as type int and sets its initial value to 2.

- The variable on the left of the assignment is called an lvalue, because it is a location that can store a value. The value that results from executing the expression on the right of the assignment is called an rvalue because it is simply a value that results from evaluating the expression.

printf("\nI have eaten %d cookies. There are %d cookies left",
eaten, cookies);
- I put the rest of the statement on a new line. You can spread statements out like this to make them easier to read or fit within a given width on the screen.

# unary operator
- operator that operates on a single operand(only one sign like + or -)

# variable and memory
- variable size depends on the compiler

    Table 2-3. Type Names for Integer Variable Types
    signed char 1   128 to +127
    short int 2     32,768 to +32,767
    int 4          2,147,438,648 to +2,147,438,647    
    long int 4     2,147,438,648 to +2,147,438,647    
    long long int 8 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807

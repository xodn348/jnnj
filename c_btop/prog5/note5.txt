# ch5. Arrays
Array = [element1, element2, element3, ...]
element can be int, float, long.

index value = 0, 1, 2, 3..(offset = distance from the)
index value should be valid integer in arrays.
ex) when not pick up valid integer,
At best youâ€™ll just pick up a junk value from somewhere so that the results are incorrect and may vary from one run to the next. 
At worst the program may overwrite something important and lock up your computer so a reboot becomes necessary.

The offset is essentially the difference (or distance) between the index of a particular element and the index of the first element.

# memory recap
For long variables:
a: 0x16fdff190
b: 0x16fdff188 (190 - 8 = 188)
c: 0x16fdff180 (188 - 8 = 180)
For double variables:
d: 0x16fdff178 (180 - 8 = 178)
e: 0x16fdff170 (178 - 8 = 170)
f: 0x16fdff168 (170 - 8 = 168)

1. The stack grows downward in memory (from high addresses to low addresses)
2. Variables are typically allocated in the order they're declared

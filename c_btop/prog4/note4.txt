# Ch4.Loops

# for loop
int count;
for(count = 1 ; count <= 10 ; ++count)
    printf("\n%d", count);
or
count = 1;
for(; count <= 10; ++count)
    printf("\n%d", count);

1. count =1 is execut4ed only once at the first.(first control expresstion)
2. count <= 10 is evaluated before each loop and it must be a logical expression(second control expression)
second control expression iterates until it gets false.
3. ++count 

# multiple variables in for loop
for(int i = 1, j = 2 ; i<=5 ; i++, j = j+2)
printf("\n %5d", i*j);

# prefix and postfix
1. prefix : ++ count
2. postfix : count++
3, use parenthesis like this
x = (a++) + b;
y = a + (++b);

ex) postfix(count variable add first, then add 1)
total = 6 + count++;
is same as 
total = 6 + count;
++count;

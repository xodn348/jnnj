# ch6 Applications with strings and text
1. 
\ : back slash(escape character)
\0 : null character(not to be confused with NULL, and you write it as \0.)

2. 
char saying[20];
The variable saying that you’ve declared in this statement can accommodate a string that has
up to 19 characters, because you must allow one element for the termination character.

3. 
const char message[] = "The end of the world is nigh";
printf("\nThe message is: %s", message);
This technique for defining standard messages is particularly useful if they’re used in various places within a program

4. 
while(str1[count])
count++;

The ASCII code value for the '\0' character is zero which corresponds to the Boolean value false. All other
ASCII code values are nonzero and therefore correspond to the Boolean value true. Thus the loop will continue as
long as str1[count] is not '\0', which is precisely what you want.
